# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository by **H.M. Mehedi Hasan (Badhon)**.

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and code files dedicated to various Natural Language Processing techniques. Each module focuses on different aspects of text processing and analysis.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for understanding and implementing various NLP techniques. From basic text processing like tokenization and stemming to advanced methods like word embeddings and text classification, each module is designed to provide insights and practical implementations.

## Contents

Here's a detailed list of modules available in this repository:

### 1. Regex_find_anything_from_text
Focuses on using regular expressions for text extraction. It covers the fundamentals of regex and their application in extracting specific patterns or information from text data.
### 2. nltk_vs_spacy
Compares and contrasts NLTK and Spacy libraries for text processing, highlighting their strengths and differences.

### 3. Tokenization in Spacy
Demonstrates tokenization using Spacy, a critical step in text processing where text is segmented into individual units such as words or sentences.

### 4. Stemming and Lemmatization
Explores stemming and lemmatization techniques, which are used to normalize words to their base or root forms.

### 5. Part_of_speech_POS_Tagging
Implements part-of-speech tagging, a process of marking words in a text according to their parts of speech.

### 6. Named_Entity_Recognition_(NER)
Demonstrates Named Entity Recognition, a technique to identify and classify named entities in text into predefined categories.

### 7. Bag_of_Words.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook focusing specifically on the bag-of-words technique, providing detailed explanations and examples.

### 8. Stop_words
Explores and handles stop words in text data, which are commonly occurring words often removed in NLP tasks.

### 9. Pipeline_in_Spacy
Uses Spacy's pipeline architecture for text processing tasks, showcasing its efficiency in handling multiple NLP tasks.

### 10. tf_idf
Implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a statistical measure used to evaluate word importance in a document.

### 11. Word_embeddings
Explores various word embedding techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe, transforming words into numerical vectors.

### 12. text_classification_using_spacy
Utilizes the Spacy library for text classification tasks.
### 13. word_vectors_gensim
Implements word vectors using the Gensim library. 

### 14. News_classification_using_gensim_word_vector
Classifies news articles using Gensim word vectors, showcasing their application in real-world scenarios.

### 15. fast_test
Explores the FastText library for efficient learning of word representations and text classification. 

### 16. Text_classification_using_fasttext
Implements text classification using FastText.
